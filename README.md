# Sprocket Central Pty Ltd Data Analytics Approach
## Introduction
Sprocket Central is a company that specializes in high-quality bikes and cycling accessories. Their marketing team is looking to boost business sales by analyzing provided datasets. The aim is to analyze and recommend 1000 customers that Sproket Central should target using three datasets.

## Data Exploration
The data analysis will include the following topics:

* New and Old Customer Distributions
* Bike related purchases over the last three years by gender
* Job industry distributions
* Wealth segmentation by age category
* Number of cars owned and not owned by state
* RFM analysis and customer classification

## Data Quality Assessment and Clean Up

The following aspects will be considered during the data quality assessment:

* Accuracy: Correct Values
* Completeness: Data Fields with Values
* Consistency: Values free from contradiction
* Currency: Values up to date
* Relevancy: Data items with value metadata
* Validity: Data containing allowable values
* Uniqueness: Records that are duplicated
## Model Development
RFM analysis and customer classification will be used to determine which customers a business should target to increase its revenue and value. The RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) model shows customers that have displayed high levels of engagement with the business in the three categories mentioned. The model development will include the following aspects:

* Scatter-plot based off RFM Analysis
* Customer title definition list with RFM values assigned
## Interpretation Introduction
The following insights can be drawn from the data analysis and model development:

* Most customers are aged between 40-49 in both New and Old customers
* Females make up the majority of bike-related sales
* The largest number of customers are classified as Mass Customer in all age categories
* Customers who purchased more recently have generated more revenue
* Customers classified as Platinum Customer, Very Loyal, and Becoming Loyal visit frequently, which is correlated with increased revenue to the business.
* Higher frequency has a negative relationship with recency values.
